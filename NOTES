-if ratox sent a friend request, is the requested person already added as a friend?
-use tox_self_get_friend_list_size() and tox_self_get_friend_list() in friendload()
-file sending seems to have gotten easier, since toxcore makes a callback when it
	wants more data to be sent (and thus read from the fifo)
-file sending: keep the last chunk 'cause it may be needed for seekback (ugh!)
-there is no more ToxAVCSettings, calling is configured for each call
-do we even need cbcallinvite()? -> No, the API is simplified now, there is only one
	callback, when a call is started by the friend. Yeah!
-TOX(AV)?_.*_CALL_CONTROL is only used when needed. In the other cases we
	just pass NULL, and deal with the return values.
-behaviour on change of bitrate? Decline? Just accept it and make the user
	deal with the consequences?
