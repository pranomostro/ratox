datastructures:
-reqerr: error codes from tox and corresponding error messages
-gfiles: files inside each of "name", "status" and so on (the gslots)
-gslots: different control directories for user-specific information
-ffiles: files in the directory for each conversation
-ustate: states of the user and corresponding strings
-transfer: something related to file transfer, I guess
-call: pretty self-explanatory, the struct for a call to a single user

callgraph:
-main()
	-printrat()
	-toxinit()
		-dataload()
		-datasave()
	-localinit()
	-friendload()
		-friendcreate()
	-loop()
		-toxconnect()
			-str2id()
		-canceltxtransfer()
		-cancelrxtransfer()
		-interval()
		-fifoopen()
		-fiforead()
		-friendcreate()
		-sendfriendtext()
		-fiforeset()
		-sendfriendfile()
		-sendfriendcalldata()
		-removefriend()
	shutdown()

-the savedata is now put into the Tox_Options struct. It is loaded automatically during
	tox_new().
-there does not seem to be a function that checks if the file is encrypted,
	so just assume that if the user says so in the config
-Tox_Options is a pointer to a struct, not the struct itself.
-RTP_PAYLOAD_SIZE is defined nowhere. wtf. https://github.com/3XX0/rtvs/blob/master/rtp.h
says
	RTP_PAYLOAD_SIZE = 16371
maybe it was defined in toxav.h/tox.h before?

Possible fixes: use the one from rtvs, TOX_MAX_CUSTOM_PACKET_SIZE (not 16371, though).
