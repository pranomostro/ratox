Changelog from the API ratox uses to the current API.

datastructures:
-reqerr: error codes from tox and corresponding error messages
-gfiles: files inside each of "name", "status" and so on (the gslots)
-gslots: different control directories for user-specific information
-ffiles: files in the directory for each conversation
-ustate: states of the user and corresponding strings
-transfer: something related to file transfer, I guess
-call: pretty self-explanatory, the struct for a call to a single user

-the savedata is now put into the Tox_Options struct. It is loaded automatically during
	tox_new().
-there does not seem to be a function that checks if the file is encrypted,
	so just assume that if the user says so in the config
-Tox_Options is a pointer to a struct, not the struct itself.
-RTP_PAYLOAD_SIZE is defined nowhere. wtf. https://github.com/3XX0/rtvs/blob/master/rtp.h
	says
		RTP_PAYLOAD_SIZE = 16371
	maybe it was defined in toxav.h/tox.h before?

	Possible fixes: use the one from rtvs, TOX_MAX_CUSTOM_PACKET_SIZE (not 16371, though).
	See also: RFC 3550, RTP.
-replace tox_do_interval by tox_iteration_interval (returns uint32_t) or toxav_iteration_interval
-it looks like ToxAvCSettings was removed. Use what instead?
-TOX_FILECONTROL_.* is replaced by TOX_FILE_CONTROL_.* or removed when not present anymore
	TOX_FILECONTROL_PAUSE->TOX_FILE_CONTROL_PAUSE
	TOX_FILECONTROL_KILL->TOX_FILE_CONTROL_CANCEL
-it looks like the typedefs are already done in tox.h and toxav.h. Why are they not applied?
-we are using tox_get_name(), which is not defined anymore. I think tox_friend_get_name is what
	we need here.
